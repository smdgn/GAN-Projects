# GAN-Projects
This is a repo implementing and evaluating several different Generative Adversarial Networks for learning purposes.  
This repo still needs a lot of refactoring and clean-up and is for learning purposes only.  
You can read my summary of the evaluation [here.](https://github.com/smdgn/GAN-Projects/blob/master/Assessment_of_GANs_V1_0.pdf)
